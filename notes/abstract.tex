These lecture notes provide a brief introduction to methods
used to search for a stochastic background of gravitational 
radiation---a superposition of gravitational-wave signals 
that are either too weak or too numerous to individually detect.
The focus of these notes is on the relevant data analysis 
techniques, not on
the particular astrophysical or cosmological sources that 
are responsible for producing the background.
The lectures are divided into two main parts:
(i) an overview, consisting of a description of different 
types of gravitational-wave backgrounds and an introduction 
to the method of cross-correlating data from multiple detectors
to extract the signal from the noise;
(ii) details, extending the previous discussion to 
non-trivial detector response, non-trivial overlap functions,
and a recently proposed Bayesian method to search for the 
gravitational-wave background produced by stellar-mass binary 
black hole mergers throughout the universe.
Suggested exercises for the reader are given throughout 
the text, and compiled in an appendix.
