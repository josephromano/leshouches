These lecture notes provide a brief introduction to methods used to
search for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation---a
superposition of gravitational-wave signals that are either too weak
or too numerous to individually detect.  The focus of these notes is
on relevant data analysis techniques, not on the particular
astrophysical or cosmological sources that are responsible for
producing the background.  The lecture notes are divided into two main
parts: (i) an overview, consisting of a description of different types
of gravitational-wave backgrounds and an introduction to the method of
cross-correlating data from multiple detectors, which can be used to
extract the signal from the noise; (ii) details, extending the
previous discussion to non-trivial detector response, non-trivial
overlap functions, and a recently proposed Bayesian method to search
for the gravitational-wave background produced by stellar-mass binary
black hole mergers throughout the universe.  Suggested exercises for
the reader are given throughout the text, and compiled in an appendix.
