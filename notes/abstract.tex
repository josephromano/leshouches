These lecture notes provide a brief introduction to methods
used to search for a stochastic background of gravitational 
radiation---a superposition of gravitational-wave signals 
that are either too weak or too numerous to individually detect.
The lectures are divided into two parts:
(i) an overview, consisting of a description of different 
types of gravitational-wave backgrounds and an introduction 
to the method of cross-correlating data from multiple detectors
to extract signal from noise;
(ii) details, extending the previous discussion to 
non-trivial detector response, non-trivial overlap functions,
and a recently proposed Bayesian method to search for the 
gravitational-wave background produced by stellar-mass binary 
black hole mergers throughout the universe.
Suggested exercises for the reader are given throughout 
the text, and compiled in an appendix.
